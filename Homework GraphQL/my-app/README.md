# How to start

### `run index.js` from ./graphQL-server/
There will be graphQL-server schema (queries, mutation, subscription).

### `create React-Apollo-Client` and use files from ./my-app/src
### `Query.js, App.js` are the main files
There will be graphQL-client who can get data from server, do mutations (add product or delete product).
